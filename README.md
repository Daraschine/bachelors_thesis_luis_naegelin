# Disclaimer and declaration of autorship:
# 
# The following code has been written by me (Luis Nägelin) without the direct help of any other person.
# I have used tools like Stack-overflow and ChatGPT to write the code.
# The data used in the analysis was downloaded with the "NYT_load_data_over_api"-script, then cleaned with the "NYT_data_cleaning"-script
# and finaly the results are visualized with the "Visualisations" R script.
#
# It was not possible to upload the raw data do this repository (because of the structure and the size) but you will find all my results in the csv-files, "frequ_articles_type", "type_material"
# and most importently in the file "sentiment_results".
# Additionaly there are csv-files used in the analysis like the inflation expectation and the data from the michigan survey.
